   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure Your Solana Wallet:**
   ```sh
   solana config set --keypair /path/to/your/keypair.json
   ```
4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Enter API keys and configurations
   ```
5. **Train the AI Model (Optional but Recommended):**
